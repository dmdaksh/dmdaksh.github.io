# Daksh Maheshwari's Personal Website

You can access my website at [daksh.com](https://dmdaksh.com/).

This website is a work in progress. I will be adding more content and features in the future.

This is the repository for my website. It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This website is based on the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme. For more information on using the theme, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/CUSTOMIZE.md).

## Running the website locally

To run the website locally, you must install Docker on your machine. You can download Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

Once you have Docker installed, you can run the following command to start the website:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
